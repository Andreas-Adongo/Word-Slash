                    Word slash, as you guessed it, is used for typing documents and can be a really powerful tool to help children learn about 
                    the basics of a text editor and also for those who are beginners at programing. This is because for a beginner a very simple 
                    text editor is often the best option for use as it helps you to get started in understanding how to really type out every line
                    of code.
