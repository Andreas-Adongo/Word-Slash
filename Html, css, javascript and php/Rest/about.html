        <p>
            Word slash is an application designed by Andreas Adongo. A student in Ghana who studies General Science.
            The designer of this application acknowledges the fact that the application may not be taillored for every one but 
            this is just a project in every way.             
        </p>

            Although it is just a project, it does not mean that it is no way usable. Infact it is 100% usable 
            and will allow kids to get a better grasp of the concept of programing.
            the fact that it does not support auto-complete does not mean it is facing a handicap against the other 
            big text editors. Infact it just means that kids would have to hard code the recomended code to get the 
            desired results.
